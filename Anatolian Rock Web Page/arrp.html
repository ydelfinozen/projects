                    <p> Anatolian Rock Revival Project (abbreviated ARRP, Anadolu Rock Diriliş Proje in Turkish) 
                        is a non-profit art project and YouTube channel that aims to promote the pop and jazz genres
                        of Turkey's history, especially rock music. It was started by Gökhan Yücel in 2014.

                        The project, which covers the period between 1964 and 1980, was brought together with an 
                        illustration drawn by a volunteer artist after recording and transferring the works produced in 
                        record or cassette format by various artists and music groups in this period to digital media,
                        making their analogue and digital remasters, and publishing these works. It is based on the 
                        principle of adding subtitles in English and other languages to published works. 
                        An example description for one their videos is showed down below.

                <div>
                    <p>
                        Selda Bağcan is a legendary Turkish singer and political activist. Her first singles, about 
                        political struggle and the demands of the working class, sold over 1 million copies. Selda’s 
                        psychedelic interpretations of traditional Turkish folk music and her political views have lost 
                        Selda her passport and caused her to be repeatedly imprisoned during the 70s and 80s.
                        Her career as a professional musician started in 1971, during her final year at the university,
                        with the encouragement and support of the Ankara-based music producer Erkan Özerman. The six singles 
                        she released that year, in which she interpreted traditional Turkish folk songs in a strong, emotional 
                        voice, accompanied by a simple acoustic guitar or bağlama, carried her to national fame. 
                        In 1972, she was selected by the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs to represent Turkey
                        in the international Golden Orpheus song contest. She released twelve more singles and three LP records 
                        until 1980 and toured many cities in Turkey and western Europe. Many of her songs carried strong social 
                        criticism and solidarity with the poor and the working class, which made her especially popular among the 
                        eft-wing activists and sympathizers during the politically polarized 1970s.
                        She experimented with rock and roll and with synthetic and electronic sounds in her LPs, although her musical 
                        style remained firmly rooted in the folk tradition. After the 1980 Turkish coup d'état, she was persecuted by 
                        the military rulers due to her political songs and was imprisoned three times between 1981 and 1984. Her passport
                        was confiscated and held by the authorities until 1987, which, among other things, prevented her from attending 
                        the first WOMAD Reading festival in 1986. Partly thanks to pressure from WOMAD, her passport was returned in 1987
                        and she immediately started a European tour, giving concerts in the Netherlands and the United Kingdom in the
                        same year.

                        Since then, she has produced several albums and given concerts in many cities in Turkey and all over the world,
                        and remains active in the Turkish musical scene. Her 1993 single Uğurlar Olsun (Farewell), a lament she composed 
                        for the assassinated journalist Uğur Mumcu, was immensely popular and quickly became a symbol for the political 
                        turbulence of the 1990s, a period marked by several unsolved high-profile assassinations in Turkey. In late 2000, 
                        she was badly injured in a car accident on her way to a concert in Antakya, suffering several broken bones as well 
                        as contusions and cuts all over her body.  She was able to make full recovery after a lengthy period of treatment. 
                        She expressed solidarity with the Gezi Park protests of 2013, even though she was not able to physically participate i
                        n the protests due to a concert in Belgium.  In November 2014, Selda headlined Le Guess Who? Festival in Utrecht, 
                        The Netherlands, together with bands that admitted to being influenced by her music, including St. Vincent, Tune-Yards 
                        and Suuns and Jerusalem In My Heart.
                        Her music has been sampled by several musicians outside of Turkey, including the band 2manydjs and hip-hop artists Mos 
                        Def, Oh No, and Dr. Dre.
                        Bağcan currently lives in Istanbul.

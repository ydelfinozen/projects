                        <p>
                            Erkin Koray is a Turkish musician, 
                            electro-baglama player, and active in Anatolian rock.
                            <br>
                            Koray has been in the Turkish folk music scene since the late 1950s. In 1957, 
                            he and his band began playing covers of Elvis Presley and Fats Domino. In 1967, 
                            he released his first psychedelic single ,<em>"Anma Arkadaş"</em>. Koray followed this with a number of singles, 
                            both by himself and in collaboration with others. In the early 1970s, he formed the 
                            group <em> Ter ("Sweat")</em>, with former members of the band <em>Bunalim (Group Depression)</em>.
                            They only recorded one single, "Hor Görme Garibi", before breaking up.
                            <br>
                            In 1973, his first album, Erkin Koray, was released, with singles from 1967 to 1973.
                            In Turkish music circles he is often referred to as <em>Erkin Baba ("Erkin the Father")</em> 
                            for his pioneering influence on Turkish popular music. Other hits by Koray are 
                            "Fesuphanallah", "Istemem", "Sevince", "Öyle Bir Geçer Zaman ki", "Estarabim", "Arap Saci", 
                            "Yalnizlar Rihtimi", "Akrebin Gözleri", and "Çöpçüler". Koray is the inventor
                            of electro baglama, the electrified version of a traditional Turkish musical instrument related to the lute.

                    <h2 class="anatolianrockh2">Cem Karaca</h2>
                        <p>
                        Turkish rock pioneer Cem Karaca was born April 5, 1945. 
                        He first performed in a cover band called "the Dynamites," followed an Elvis Presleytribute group called "the Jaguars";
                        and from there Karaca eventually began writing his own original songs, honing a massively influential style that combined 
                        traditional Anatolian lyrics with cutting-edge contemporary rock melodies. According to legend, his father hired people to 
                        'boo' at early performances in the hopes that the catcalls would persuade his son to quit singing and pursue a career as a 
                        diplomat -- instead, Karaca proved instantly popular, essentially launching the modern Turkish rock sound with his band 
                        Apaslar's self-titled 1967 debut LP. The group proved short-lived, however, and two years later, Karaca and bassist 
                        Serhan Karabay formed a new unit, <em>Kardaslar (in English, "Brothers")</em>. 
                        <br>
                        With his trademark felt hat, large glasses, and long hair, by the dawn of the 1970s Karaca was not only Turkey's biggest pop star, 
                        but he was also a countercultural icon -- his songs were intensely political, fusing patriotic zeal with leftist ideologies that 
                        harshly criticized Turkey's growing right-wing sect. In 1972, he joined the group Mogollar and recorded his acknowledged 
                        masterpiece Namus Belasi. As Turkey's political unrest escalated, so did the polemical force of Karaca's music.
                        He argued that his allegiance to Turkey was greater than his dedication 
                        to any political party, celebrating peace, nationalism, and Islamic faith on solo records like 1989's "Merhaba Gencler 
                        and Her Zaman Genc Kalanhar". Karaca continued recording and touring until his death from heart failure on February 8, 2004.

                        <p>
                            With the release of her first album Develerle Yaşiyorum (2014) and her first international album “Hologram İmparatorluğu” (2016), 
                            Gaye Su Akyol established herself as one of Turkeys most compelling young voices and most exhilarating sonic explorers. 
                            Her work as a singer-songwriter, producer and audio/visual conceptualist, simultaneously navigates the storied past, 
                            the hyper-connected present and the unscripted future.   Growing up in cosmopolitan Istanbul listening to Anatolian music 
                            icon Selda Bağcan and Kurt Cobain in equal measure, Akyol skipped right over the tired Oriental/Occidental paradigmatic clichés. 
                            Gayes music was global in concept and local in spirit and nuance right from the very beginning.   
                            <br>
                            “Istikrarli Hayal Hakikattir,” which translates as “Consistent Fantasy is Reality,” is a deeply poetic album; 
                            an album of personalized politics, an album that digs into the heart our contentious, inexplicable contemporary 
                            experience.  “Anadolu Ejderi” is the fourth album in GSAs discography. Like her other albums, it is a completely 
                            independent DIY manifesto that draws its strength from its freedom and refusal of accountability to anyone.

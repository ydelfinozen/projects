                                Anatolian rock (Turkish: Anadolu rock), or known as Turkish psychedelic rock, 
                                is a fusion of Turkish folk music and rock. It emerged during the mid-1960s, 
                                soon after rock groups became popular in Turkey. Most known members of this genre 
                                includes Turkish musicians such as Bariş Manço, Cem Karaca, Erkin Koray, Selda Bağcan, 
                                Fikret Kizilok alongside bands such as Moğollar, Kurtalan Ekspres and 3 Hürel.

                        <h4>I Feel Like A Drunk Man by Erkin Koray</h4>
                        <p>
                            You left me in a desert of love
                            I feel like a bird whose wings are broken
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            You didn't ask about me, not even for a day
                            I feel like a stone which is thrown to the street
                            <br>
                            <br>                            
                            That old imagination of you is always in front of me
                            My tears fall down whenever I remember you
                            The wine of separation is in the bowl of heart
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            I feel like a drunk who got collapsed without even drinking
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            See that without you agony has settled to my chest
                            Autumn has already come to the mountain of my heart
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Don't you believe that I am alive
                            I feel like dead since you've gone
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            That old imagination of you is always in front of me
                            My tears fall down whenever I remember you
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            The wine of separation is in the bowl of heart
                            I feel like a drunk man who got collapsed without even drinking
                        </p>
                        <h4>My friend, what is your homeland?</h4>
                        <p>
                            My friend, what is your homeland?
                            Ever since I can think, I have spent this huge long life on the road
                            From one end to another have I travelled this mortal world
                            Scholars, ignorants, the poor, the rich; there is no difference, they are all the same
                            Finally, I, too, have understood what makes the world go 'round1
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            As though humanity had gone out to the market, the bread in the lion's mouth
                            No one saying “Would you like to drink a hot soup?”
                            Whoever erects their four walls, closes his roof and locks the door
                            No one saying “Let's get a set of blankets for you, too, come in.”
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Just one question: “My fellow, what's yer homeland?”4
                            This world is my homeland
                            No, you misunderstand, my fellow, where's yer actual hometown?
                            This world is my homeland
                            (Dear heavens, dear heavens, dear heavens)5
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            While giving long and drawn-out speeches on brotherhood and equity,
                            many still say: “Why is your skin darker than mine?”
                            While someone is being shot and runs towards their death because they have eyes under their eyebrows,
                            nobody stops to ask “What will the left-behind widow and the orphan eat or drink?”
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            The poor peace has not found the solution, sitting down after having said so many words
                            There is no one saying “Let us all come to an understanding”
                            Our world has already become shattered into pieces and uninhabitable, anyway
                            There is no need to cut it up and divide it any further
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Just one question: “My fellow, what's yer homeland?”
                            This world is my homeland
                            No, you misunderstand, my fellow, where's yer actual hometown?
                            No, but I already said:
                            This world is my homeland
                            (Dear heavens, dear heavens, dear heavens)

                <h2 class="anatolianrockh2">History and Development</h2>
                <p class="anatolianrocktext2">
                    Background (1930s-1960s): Anatolian rock has a long history that dates back to the founding of the Turkish Republic decades ago.
                    Modern Turkey's founding father, Atatürk, pushed extensive changes to build a national form of music from 
                    the early 1930s forward. Atatürk believed that the changes in music to be based on national and modern 
                    foundations and musicians should work on Turkish melodies and make them polyphonic according to the rules 
                    of Western harmonic music. As a result, Anatolian folk music began to spread and people began to listen 
                    Anatolian folk tunes instead of Ottoman music.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In the 1950s, rock & roll music began to be played and rock groups such as The Beatles, 
                    The Rolling Stones, Led Zeppelin, Yes, Status Quo and Omega became popular especially in Istanbul. 
                    It began to spread and became popular among the elite youth of the city. In Istanbul, high school and university 
                    students began forming their own bands and performing covers of rock'n roll and twist music in 1957. Students which 
                    will become famous singers later, such as Bariş Manço from Galatasaray High School and Erkin Koray from German High School, 
                    they both performed at an amateur concert they have organized, which is known as the first rock'n roll concert of Turkey. 
                    Turkish singers such as Erol Büyükburç began to release English-language cover versions of American songs, as well as their own songs.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Golden age of Anatolian rock and Turkish psychedelic rock (1960s-1980s): In 1957, Turkish radio stations played surf rock by 
                    the Tornados or the Ventures and films with Elvis Presley and Bill Haley were shown in Turkish cinemas. 
                    This inspired musicians like Erkin Koray to start already in 1957 with cover versions of rocknroll tunes, 
                    using the new electric guitar. By the early 1960s, Turkish groups began to perform instrumentals, such as those by
                    The Shadows and The Ventures. Although often locally popular performers, these Turkish groups were rarely recorded. 
                    The first original Turkish-language pop song was "Ayrilanlar İçin", released in 1964 by Timur Selçuk. Other singers also emerged, 
                    including Bariş Manço, who first recorded in the early 1960s before later spearheading the growth of Turkish rock music in the 1970s 
                    with albums such as 2023 (1975) and become the father of Anatolian Rock. At the same time, Turkish society began to undergo significant 
                    cultural changes, including the growth of multi-party democracy in the region.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The domestic rock music scene in Turkey expanded rapidly in the mid- and late 1960s. In 1963, 
                    Erkin Koray published "One September Night" (Bir Eylül Akşami) which is regarded as the first rock'n roll 
                    song in Turkish language and opened a new era, the Turkish psychedelic rock. From 1968 to about 1975, 
                    psychedelic rock became popular in Turkey, notably the work of guitarist Erkin Koray, regarded as a "hugely influential 
                    figure on the Istanbul music scene". The band Moğollar are credited with "changing the landscape of Turkish rock by incorporating 
                    elements of Anatolian folk music," and, after recording in France as Les Mogols, named their musical genre Anadolu Pop. Another pioneer, 
                    Fikret Kizilok, combined the style of Anadolu Pop with overtly political lyrics, and experiments with electronic music.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Turkish musicians also regularly performed at competitive European music festivals. In 1964, Tülay German performed the song 
                    "Burçak Tarlasi" at the Balkan Music Festival, in a bossa nova style, and became immediately popular. As a direct result, 
                    the newspaper Hürriyet organized a "Golden Microphone" (Altin Mikrofon) competition, to encourage the development of new songs 
                    in Turkish blending folk tune and Western style. This helped identify a new generation of musicians, including the groups Mavi Işiklar, 
                    Silüetler, and musicians Cem Karaca, Edip Akbayram, Selçuk Alagöz, and his sister Rana Alagöz. Finalists were awarded with an opportunity 
                    to record a 45rpm-disc, and a tour across the country. As a result, it caused people outside the big cities to be exposed to this genre.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The end of Anatolian rock era (1980):Anatolian Rock remained popular until the late 1970s. During these times,
                    some musicians have taken a stand in support of the common people. One such person was Selda Bagcan. Musicians like Bagcan were able to 
                    speak directly to the people. For young, popular music became synonymous with leftist thinking, protests for greater equality, freedom 
                    and worker's rights. The left-wing views of these artists did not endear them to the authorities. By 1970s went on, economic recession 
                    and social unrest has arisen across Turkey and on 12 September 1980, military coup brought the Anatolian rock genre to an end. Left-wing 
                    rockers faced repression, while the gloomy political atmosphere boosted the popularity of the melancholic Arabesque genre during the 80s.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    After the coup, rock musicians were banned from performing, many artists had to fled abroad such as Cem Karaca and some were imprisoned.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Era of Turkish rock (After 1990s):As other rock genres gained popularity in Turkey, Anatolian rock also began to diversify and Turkish 
                    rock that came out of this period, was far from its traditional roots, Anatolian style and has no connection with folk music.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In last decades, there has been a growth of Turkish rock bands such as Duman, Mor ve Ötesi, Gece Yolculari, Almora, Kurban, Kargo, 
                    Vega, Çilekeş, Redd, Gripin and maNga, the latter having won the "Best Rock Band" award in almost all polls in 2005. Besides, 
                    due to the Turkish migration to Germany, several Turkish-rooted bands also evolved in Germany 
                    e.g. In the 1980s as alternative groups: Ünlü (from 1981 on, at the beginning named Fahrstuhl) and the Trial (from 1985 on).
                    The influences acting upon all these bands fall into a wide range of genres, from the Seattle Sound to heavy or doom metal and rapcore. 
                    Hence, Anatolian rock refers to a fusion of a wide selection of western rock subgenres with either a traditional Turkish sound or even 
                    rock music with Turkish lyrics. Such cultural fusion led the way for rock music to develop in Turkey.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    There are also individual rock performers who have gained success such as Ayna, Murat Göğebakan, Haluk Levent, Şebnem Ferah, 
                    Bariş Akarsu, Ogün Sanlisoy, Demir Demirkan, Hayko Cepkin, Asli Gökyokuş, Nev, Aylin Aslim, Emre Aydin, Kiraç, Özlem Tekin and Teoman. 
                    By the end of the 1980s, several metal groups formed in Turkey such as Mezarkabul (Pentagram), and Diken.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    2010s: In late 2010s, some rock musicians and bands appeared that harmonizes the folk tunes with rock, such as Turkish singer 
                    Gaye Su Akyol, and bands like Palmiyeler, Ayyuka, Makas and Dutch Anatolian rock band Altin Gün. 
                    In 2014, Anatolian Rock Revival Project has started with the vision of preserving the culture of Anatolian rock and transferring it to future generations.
